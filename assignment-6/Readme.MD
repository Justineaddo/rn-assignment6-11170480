### How Async Storage Works

# Initialization:
Installing an async storage library, such as AsyncStorage, in your React Native app is the first step. The ability to store and retrieve data asynchronously is offered by this library.

# Data Storage:
The AsyncStorage library provides a method called setItem() for storing data. This method takes two parameters:
The key is the first parameter, which is a string that identifies the data being stored.
The second parameter is the value, which is the data that will be stored.

# Data Retrieval:
The AsyncStorage library provides a method called getItem() for retrieving data. This method takes one parameter, which is the key of the data that you want to retrieve.
